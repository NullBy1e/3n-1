# 3n-1

I wanted to check the speed of different languages.

To measure the speed of language I calculate the numbers by collatz conjecture(en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)

For now I have:
  - Python3
  - Golang
  - Golang (async)
  - C++
  - Swift
  - C#
  - Java
  - Bash

I tested on my Macbook pro 16" base model

I used the time utility to show execution time
